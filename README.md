# HRM Architecture example

This is the implementation of the HRM (Hierarchical Reasoning Model), that I used to study how to create the multi level approach to reasoning models. 

Results are not great, and are still in early development. Take this with a grain of salt. I tried to make a simple version, without much of the data computations necessary for it to work really well. 

Feel free to suggest and improve upon this project. Would love to hear from folks that know better ;)




## Generate the Dataset 

Example command line:

`python dataset/build_dataset.py --output-dir ./data --sample-size 10000 --difficulty 7`
